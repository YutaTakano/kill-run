# kill-run

MOTIVATION

I was fiddling around with my graphics settings for my CS:GO game because of some really anoying FPS issues.
I thought I should close background processes/startup items that are active but that I don't need during my game, but I wanted a way to do it in one click.
I also wanted to be able to reload them once I was done.

So, that's how I got started writing this tiny little applescript app.
It is my first real commit to my github repo. 



FUNCTIONALITY

I hard coded in a number of processes and apps that run in the background. 
When the app opens, these processes will be shut off one by one with a notification displaying their successes.

When reactivating, it shows a list of the processes that I had hard coded in and I can choose which ones to reopen.
